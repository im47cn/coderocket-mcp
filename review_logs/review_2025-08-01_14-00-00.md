**Subject:** feat: 更新版本号至1.1.5，确保代码与最新发布一致 (feat: Update version number to 1.1.5 to ensure code is consistent with the latest release)

## 1. Summary

This commit updates the application's version number to `1.1.5` in `package.json` and `src/index.ts`. The change is straightforward and aligns with the release preparation process.

## 2. Analysis and Recommendations

### Code Consistency

The changes correctly update the version number in both `package.json` and the hardcoded fallback variable in `src/index.ts`.

### Potential Improvement

The current implementation requires updating the version number in two separate locations. This is a potential source of error if one location is missed during a version bump.

In `src/index.ts`, the version is read from `package.json`, but a hardcoded version string is used as a fallback:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
// ...
  constructor() {
    // 读取实际版本号
    let version = '1.1.5'; // 默认版���
    try {
      const packagePath = resolve(__dirname, '../package.json');
      const packageJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(packagePath, 'utf-8'));
// ...
```

**Recommendation:**

To make the versioning more robust and maintain a single source of truth, consider removing the hardcoded version in `src/index.ts`. The version should be read exclusively from `package.json`. If the file cannot be read, the application could either throw an error on startup or log a warning and proceed with an "unknown" version string. This would prevent inconsistencies in the future.

For example:

```typescript
// src/index.ts (suggested change)
// ...
  constructor() {
    let version = 'unknown'; // Default to 'unknown' or handle error more gracefully
    try {
      const packagePath = resolve(__dirname, '../package.json');
      const packageJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(packagePath, 'utf-8'));
      version = packageJson.version;
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Could not read version from package.json', error);
      // Depending on requirements, you might want to exit here
      // process.exit(1);
    }
    this.version = version;
// ...
```

This approach ensures that `package.json` is the single source of truth for the version number.

## 3. Conclusion

The commit is approved as it fulfills its intended purpose. However, adopting the recommendation above would improve the maintainability of the codebase.
